                  On her way she met a copy. The copy warned the Little Blind Text,
                  that where it came from it would have been rewritten a thousand times and
                  everything that was left from its origin would be the word and
                  the Little Blind Text should turn around and return to its own,
                  safe country. But nothing the copy said could
                  convince her and so it didnâ€™t take long until a few insidious Copy Writers
                  ambushed her, made her drunk with Longe and Parole and dragged her into their
                  agency, where they abused her for their.
